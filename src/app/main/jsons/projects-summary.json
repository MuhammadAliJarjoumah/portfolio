    "description": "This is a dynamic Sudoku game developed using React and TypeScript as part of the NavyBits Internship Challenge. It features a user-friendly interface, robust game logic with validation, a puzzle generator, and a manual solver. A .NET Core API using OpenCvSharp and TesseractOCR was explored for an image-based solver stretch goal, demonstrating backend and OCR integration. This API work is not included in the main repository due to ongoing accuracy refinements.",
